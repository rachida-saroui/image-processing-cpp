# Image Processing in C++

This repository contains a series of image processing exercises implemented in C++. These exercises cover fundamental techniques and operations in image processing, such as color space transformations, histogram modifications, frequency domain filtering, convolution, morphological operations, and shape analysis. This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of various image processing tasks, ideal for both learning and practical applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several exercises, each focusing on a different aspect of image processing:

1. **Color Spaces and Histograms**  
   - Implement 1D histogram analysis, color space transformations (RGB, HSV, Lab), and pixel detection based on color characteristics.
2. **Histogram Modification**  
   - Perform histogram stretching and equalization to enhance image contrast, with a discussion on the advantages and limitations of each method.
3. **Frequency Domain Representation**  
   - Apply Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency analysis, and implement low-pass and high-pass filtering for image enhancement.
4. **Convolution and Image Filtering**  
   - Implement convolution operations and Gaussian filtering to highlight image features.
5. **Classification**  
   - Apply k-means clustering for pixel classification within images, identifying regions based on color similarity.
6. **Mathematical Morphology**  
   - Implement erosion and dilation operations to modify image structure, ideal for noise reduction and structure enhancement.
7. **Connected Component Labeling**  
   - Label connected components within an image to segment distinct regions.
8. **Edge Detection**  
   - Use gradient norm and Laplacian zero-crossing methods to detect image edges.
9. **Shape Analysis and Road Sign Recognition**  
   - Use contour signatures, compacity, and Hough transformations to recognize shapes such as circles and polygons, enabling basic object recognition.
10. **Counting Buildings from Aerial Images**  
    - Use HSV color filtering, morphological operations, and contour detection to identify and count building rooftops in aerial images.
